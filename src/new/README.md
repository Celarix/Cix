# Cix: New Project

In an attempt to clean up the code, add valuable logging support, and to associate tokens and AST elements with files and line numbers, the Cix solution will be recreated. Most of the code from the old Cix project will be imported but cleaned up.

This is NOT a complete restart of the project, just a chance to reorganize it.
