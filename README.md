Cix
===

A C-based language for the [https://github.com/ChrisAkridge/IronArc](IronArc) virtual processor project. Cix is Turing-complete, supports most of the things you'd expect in a low-level language, including functions, structs, pointers, strings, many numeric types, and global variables. Cix doesn't require header files or forward declaration, and has a simpler syntax for function pointers over C.

This repository contains documentation and source code for a working C# compiler for the Cix language.
