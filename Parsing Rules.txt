Cix Parsing Stages:

Stage 1: Character Level Parsing:
	Contexts:
		- Root: No context has been set yet.
		- Whitespace: The last character was a whitespace or line terminator.
		- Comment: A // or /* sequence not inside a string literal was found and no line terminator or */ sequence has been reached yet.
		- Word: The last charater was a character in a word or identifier not inside a string literal.
		- Directive: A # character not inside a string literal was found, and no whitespace has been reached yet.
		- Operator: The last character was an operator character.
		- NumericLiteral: A number after whitespace not inside a string literal was found, and no . character, {u l f d} character, or whitespace has been reached yet.
		- NumericLiteralFraction. A . character was found during a NumericLiteral context, and no {u l f d} character or whitespace has been reached yet.
		- NumericLiteralSuffix: A {u l f d} character was found during a NumericLiteral or NumericLiteralFraction context, and no whitespace has been reached yet.
		- StringLiteral: An unescaped " character not inside a string literal was found, and no matching unescaped " character has been reached yet.
